Software to be installed prior:
   1. Apache2/Tomcat7 (obviously)
   2. Unzip
   3. mono (c#/.net framework for linux)

Version 1.0
   As of version 1.0 the default install directories are as listed below.
	In subsequent versions will be updating it to use a config file

   Tomcat:
	   webapps dir: "/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/"
		This is where the c# program is currently pointed to.

	Share Folder:
	   location:    "/usr/local/tomshare/"
		permissions: "777" So all users can deploy to it.
		   *Might change later to handle groups.

Version 1.1
   Will be including an update to help manage a less hard coded configuration.

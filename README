Tomcat manager software controls opening war files and deploying them to the tomcat root.

Software to be installed prior:
   1. Apache2/Tomcat7 (obviously)
   2. Unzip
   3. mono (c#/.net framework for linux)

To Install->
   1. Set up the required software ^
   2. Install the the tomcatmanager.exe somewhere out of reach from 
      regular users (I used "/root/")
   3. Configure the C# program
      a. With version 1.0 Recompile the app with the tomcat webapp directory, 
         the share directory, and the temporary storage location ("/tmp/" Should work for this.)
      b. With version 1.1 There will be a config file with this information.
   4. Set up a crontab job as root.
      a. Using "sudo crontab -e" or being root and using "crontab -e"
      b. Add this line to the crontab file. -> "* * * * * /<locationOfExecutable>/tomcatmanager.exe"
         *Note this will run it every minute. You can change the timings. Google crontab

To Use:
   Users will just pass their .war file into the the shared directory.
   The crontab schedule will then update it with tomcat everytime the update job fires.
   No further administration is needed.

Limitations:
   1. You should have users create unique names for their war files so as to avoid collision with other projects.
   2. This only adds new .war files or replaces previously deployed projects.
      It will not delete projects that are present in the tomcat webapps directory that aren't present in the share.

Version 1.0
   As of version 1.0 the default install directories are as listed below.
	In subsequent versions will be updating it to use a config file

   Tomcat:
	   webapps dir: "/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/"
      This is where the c# program is currently pointed to.

	Share Folder:
	   location:    "/usr/local/tomshare/"
      permissions: "777" So all users can deploy to it.
		   *Might change later to handle groups.

Version 1.1
   Will be including an update to help manage a less hard coded configuration.
